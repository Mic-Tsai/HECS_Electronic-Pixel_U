# HECS Electronic | Pixel-U
## Light Painting Equipment

This was my college side project during 2013-2014 in KUAS (National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan)

2017 - Re-engineering hardware part, split the core as controller and display, purpose to minimum PCB after-assemble space. LEDs used the improved version SK6812B-3535 (package) from WS2812B-5050, got better heat radiating, smaller dot will increase the image resolution.

2018 - Base on Pixel-X prototype used the same controller board, rebuild the display layout to 40 LEDs which is smaller package (SK6812B-2427). System compare detail please refer following slide.
